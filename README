Project:   SproutCore Website
Copyright: Â©2009 Sprout Systems, Inc.
=============================================================================

This packages uses the SproutCore build system to generate the main SproutCore
website.  Because it uses the build system, it is automatically multilingual
and optimized for high-performance serving.  All assets for each page are
cached indefinitely on a browser.

Each page on the website is stored in the pages directory.  home is used to 
setup the index page.  A Capistrano file is used to automate the build 
process and deploy it to the website.

The pages load the full SproutCore framework as well as the shared_assets 
framework which includes common asset and template files.  The default 
index.html is stored here as well.
